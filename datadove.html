                            <p class="work_box-text-para">Data Dove is a premium private discord group focused on helping members secure products on the market without the hassle of fighting for them. As a new group, they had no online presence or logo. I was tasked in designing a logo for Data Dove as well as a website design. The only requirement they had for the logo was that it must include a bird or dove. </p>
                            <p class="work_box-text-para">The idea of an origami bird with straight lines came to mind immediately to keep it in the same field as tech while keeping a bird shape.</p>
                            <p class="work_box-text-para">For the website, I used the same color as the logo but added complementary colors to bring more life and personality. The background was kept dark to give off a private, secret group while using it to make the main colors more vibrant.</p>
